## Admin:

Admin user accounts can only be created manually through the Auth0 dashboard. First [create](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/create-users) a user, then [apply the admin role](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/access-control/configure-core-rbac/rbac-users/assign-roles-to-users#assign-roles-in-user-profile) to that user.

## Client:

There are 2 ways to create a user account for a client.

### Automatically through the Aqaratech admin panel (recommended):

1.  Create the client in the [Aqaratech](https://aqaratech.com/new/clients) admin panel. Make sure to enter an email and civil ID.
2.  Click the `invite` button on the client detail page.
3.  An invitation email will be sent to the client. The default password will be set to the client's civil ID number.

### Manually through the Auth0 dashboard:

1.  Create the client in the [Aqaratech](https://aqaratech.com/new/clients) admin panel. Make sure to enter an email.
1.  Take note of the client's `id`, which can be found in the url. For example, if the URL of the client's detail page is `https://aqaratech.com/clients/c313d484-2ed8-417b-bbcf-a7e318b43016`, his `id` is `c313d484-2ed8-417b-bbcf-a7e318b43016`.
1.  [Create](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/create-users) a user account through the Auth0 dashboard and [assign](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/access-control/configure-core-rbac/rbac-users/assign-roles-to-users#assign-roles-in-user-profile) it the `property-owner` role.
1.  Go to the users [Auth0 profile page](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/view-user-details#user-details-details-tab), then add the `id` from Step 2 to his `app_metadata` like so:

```json
{
	"idInternal": "c0183a5d-2875-488b-b86f-e1c5628262df"
}
```

If you're having trouble with this, take a look at existing client profiles in Auth0 to see how their `app_metadata` is set.
