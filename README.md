This repository is a mono-repo containing multiple packages located in the `packages` directory. Maintained using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [turborepo](https://turborepo.org/).

`site`: [sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) frontend.

`backend`: [nestjs](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) backend server.

`test`: End-to-end [playwright](https://playwright.dev/)tests for both site and backend.

`utils`: Various shared utilities.

`seed`: Helpers for generating realistic fake data to use for development/testing.

### Development üõ†Ô∏è

```bash
# clone the repo and scaffold .env files
git clone https://github.com/aqaratech/aqtech.git && cd aqtech && ./scripts/scaffold-worktree.sh
# run site on port 3000 and backend on port 3002. (run from root directory)
pnpm dev
```

Take a look [.env.example](.env.example) to know what env vars are required. Environment variables are validated using Zod. Description of each variable + schema in `packages/utils/src/config/env/*`

### Build üì¶

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Test üß™

```bash
pnpm run test

# Alternatively, run `precompute` in the repo root to lint, type-check, build, and test all packages.
pnpm run precompute
```

# Release

1. Create a changeset (`pnpm changeset`), commit it, push it to master.
2. A PR called "Version Packages" will be created automatically.
3. Merge the PR to trigger a release.

# Manual Tasks

```bash
# Regenerate openapi schema and types
task swagger:all
```
