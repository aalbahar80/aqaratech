This repository is a mono-repo containing multiple packages located in the `packages` directory. Maintained using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [turborepo](https://turborepo.org/).

`site`: Main site built with [sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) & `typescript`.

`backend`: Server built with [nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) & `typescript`.

`test`: End-to-end tests for both site and backend. Uses with [playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

`utils`: Various utilities used by other packages.

`seed`: Helpers for generating realistic fake data to use for development/testing.

### Development üõ†Ô∏è
